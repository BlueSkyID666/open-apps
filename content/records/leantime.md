Leantime is the project manager for teams where most people are not project managers. It sums itself up as "as simple as Trello but as feature-rich as Jira", and its maker markets it as an open-source replacement for Jira Data Center. It covers tasks, milestones, sprints, timesheets, goals and docs, and it is designed with ADHD, dyslexia and autism in mind. The core is AGPL-3.0 and self-hosts on PHP and MySQL or with Docker. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v3.10.0.

## What it does

- **Tasks** in Kanban, Gantt, table, list and calendar views, with unlimited subtasks and dependencies, milestones and sprints.
- **Time tracking and timesheets.**
- **Planning** with project dashboards, reports and status updates, goal and metrics tracking, and Lean, Business Model, SWOT and risk-analysis canvases.
- **Knowledge** in wikis and docs, idea boards, retrospectives, file storage on S3 or local disk, screen and webcam recording, and comments on everything.
- **Administration** with user roles and per-project permissions, two-factor authentication, LDAP and OIDC, plugins and an API, and integrations with Slack, Mattermost and Discord. It is available in over 20 languages.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams that want planning and strategy alongside tasks, without a Jira administrator.
- Organisations with neurodivergent staff who find dense tools hard to use.

**Look elsewhere**

- You need portfolio management and cost tracking across many projects. [OpenProject](/apps/openproject/) goes further.
- You run a software team that lives in cycles and issues. [Plane](/apps/plane/) is built for that.

## How it compares

| | Leantime | [OpenProject](/apps/openproject/) | [Plane](/apps/plane/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | Goals and simple planning | Portfolio, agile and classic PM | Software issue tracking |
| Stack | PHP, MySQL or MariaDB | Ruby on Rails, PostgreSQL | Django, React |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0, enterprise plugins | GPL-3.0, paid Enterprise add-ons | AGPL-3.0 CE, closed Commercial Edition |

The full comparison is in [open-source Jira alternatives](/collections/open-source-jira-alternatives/). More AGPL software is under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).

## Licence in practice

Leantime is AGPL-3.0, with one exception written into the README: plugins in the `/app/Plugins` directory may be under other licences, including Leantime's enterprise licence. The README marks every feature in its feature table as included in the open-source version. A self-hosted instance sends anonymous, instance-wide usage counts to `telemetry.leantime.io` once a day unless telemetry is switched off in the company settings or the `allowTelemetry` configuration.
