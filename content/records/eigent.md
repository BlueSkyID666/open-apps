bestFor:
  - Multi-step jobs that split naturally into parallel parts — research, then write, then build.
  - Recurring work that should run on a schedule while you are away.
  - Keeping accounts, chat history and model settings on your own machine with the local backend.
whyListed:
  - Apache-2.0 with no enterprise directory in the repository.
  - The multi-agent "workforce" mode is a different design from the single-agent apps in this
    category.
  - A documented local deployment keeps registration, history and provider settings in a local
    PostgreSQL database.
caveats:
  - The quick start connects to Eigent's cloud backend and needs an account. Fully local use means
    running the included server with Docker and PostgreSQL.
  - SSO, access control and custom development are sold as an enterprise offering, outside the
    repository.

Eigent is the Claude Cowork alternative to choose when one agent is not enough. Its headline mode is a "workforce": a task is broken into parts and handed to several specialised agents that work in parallel, on top of the CAMEL-AI multi-agent framework. It is Apache-2.0, ships desktop builds for all three platforms, and has been around since July 2025 — longer than most apps in this category. The catch is the default setup: the quick start talks to Eigent's cloud and wants an account, so running it locally is a deliberate step. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v1.0.5.

## Single agent or workforce

Eigent offers two ways to work. **Single agent** is the familiar pattern — one agent with browser and terminal toolkits working through a task beside you. **Workforce** splits the job across multiple agents that coordinate and run at the same time, which suits long jobs with independent parts. Both can use MCP servers and skills, and **Automation** schedules recurring workflows so they run without you.

The model is your choice: cloud APIs, enterprise gateways, or local inference. The local deployment guide names vLLM, Ollama and LM Studio.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Research-and-build tasks where parallel agents save real time.
- Teams that want an Apache-2.0 codebase they can fork without a licence split.
- Anyone willing to run a small Docker stack to keep accounts and history local.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want to install an app and go, fully offline, with no server. [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) needs no account for local use.
- You want commands sandboxed in a VM. [Open Cowork](/apps/open-cowork/) routes them through WSL2 or Lima.

## Running it locally

The desktop release works out of the box against Eigent's hosted backend. For a standalone setup, the repository's `server/` directory provides a FastAPI backend with PostgreSQL, started with `docker-compose up`; it handles local registration and login, model provider settings, chat history and MCP management, all in a local database. If you configure a cloud model or a remote MCP server, those requests still go to the provider you chose. Webhook-style app triggers need the server on a public domain.

## How it compares

| | Eigent | [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) | [Open Cowork](/apps/open-cowork/) | [OpenWorker](/apps/openworker/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Agents | Single or parallel workforce | Single | Single | Specialist "coworkers" |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 | MIT app, commercial `ee/` | MIT, bundled Anthropic skills | MIT |
| Local without account | With the Docker backend | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Since | July 2025 | January 2026 | January 2026 | July 2026 |

## Licence in practice

The whole repository is under the Apache License 2.0 — read and confirmed from the LICENSE file. There is no source-available directory; the enterprise features (SSO, access control, custom development) and the managed cloud are services Eigent sells, not code held back. Other Apache-licensed apps are under [Apache-2.0 apps](/licenses/apache-2.0/).
