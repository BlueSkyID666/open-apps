LimeSurvey is the veteran of open-source survey software: developed since 2006, it describes itself as a free alternative to SurveyMonkey, Typeform, Qualtrics and Google Forms. It is built for surveys rather than marketing forms — branching, multilingual questionnaires, closed-access invitations and statistics — and the whole repository is GPL. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at tag 7.3.0.

## What it does

- **Question design.** More than 30 question types, 900+ survey templates, skip logic and question branching.
- **Languages.** Multilingual surveys in more than 80 languages.
- **Distribution.** Public links, QR codes and social sharing, or a closed-access mode with personal invitation links.
- **Results.** Responses, statistics and data-analysis tools, with anonymisation options.
- **Integration.** A RemoteControl API over XML-RPC or JSON-RPC, a REST API, SAML and LDAP sign-in, and a plugin system for question themes, audit logs and exports.
- **Accessibility.** The README lists WCAG 2.0 compliance and two-factor authentication.

It runs on Apache or nginx with PHP 8.1 or later and MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or Microsoft SQL Server.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Universities, public bodies and research teams that must keep survey data on their own servers.
- Anyone running long, branching questionnaires in several languages.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a modern, conversational form builder. [HeyForm](/apps/heyform/) is closer to Typeform.
- You want product feedback surveys inside your app. [Formbricks](/apps/formbricks/) is built for that.

## How it compares

| | LimeSurvey | [Formbricks](/apps/formbricks/) | [HeyForm](/apps/heyform/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Since | 2006 | 2022 | 2024 (current repository) |
| Focus | Survey research | In-app and web surveys | Conversational forms |
| Stack | PHP | Next.js | Node and React |
| Licence | GPL-2.0 or later | AGPL-3.0 core, enterprise directory | AGPL-3.0 |

The comparison continues in [open-source Typeform alternatives](/collections/open-source-typeform-alternatives/). More self-hosted tools are under [Productivity](/categories/productivity/).

## Licence in practice

GPL-2.0, with the option to use any later GPL version. The LimeSurvey name and logo are registered trademarks of LimeSurvey GmbH, which also sells the hosted service.
