tags:

bestFor:
  - Teams that want auth, database, storage, functions and hosting from one self-hosted platform.
  - Mobile apps built with Flutter, Swift, Kotlin or React Native.
  - Letting Claude Code, Cursor or Codex work on a live backend through MCP.
whyListed:
  - Designed for self-hosting from the start — one Docker command runs the installer.
  - A permissive BSD-3-Clause licence, in development since 2019 with a very large community.
  - Official SDKs for web, Flutter, Apple, Android, React Native and many server languages.
caveats:
  - It does not describe itself as a Firebase alternative in its README; it is listed with them
    because it covers the same backend services.
  - The hosted MCP server is a Cloud feature; a self-hosted instance uses the local MCP server.
  - Many services behind the installer — plan server resources accordingly.

Appwrite is the broadest self-hosted backend platform in this group: authentication, databases, file storage, serverless functions, frontend hosting, messaging and realtime behind one console, with SDKs for most client and server languages. It now presents itself as "MCP and agent-first", so coding agents can work on a live project. It is BSD-3-Clause and was built with self-hosting in mind. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 2.3.0.

## What it does

- **Auth** — email, SMS, OAuth, anonymous sessions and magic URLs.
- **Databases** — Appwrite's own, or managed PostgreSQL and MySQL.
- **Storage** — files with compression, encryption, image transformations and access control.
- **Functions** — serverless functions in isolated runtimes, triggered by events.
- **Sites** — deploy static, SSR and CSR frontends from Git with previews.
- **Messaging** — email, SMS and push notifications.
- **Realtime**, **Firewall** rules, and **MCP** for agents.

SDKs cover Web, Flutter, Apple, Android and React Native on the client, and Node.js, Python, Dart, PHP, Ruby, .NET, Go, Swift, Kotlin and Rust on the server.

## Running it

Any machine with Docker can run it: a single `docker run` starts the setup wizard on port 20080, with equivalents for Windows CMD and PowerShell. Appwrite Cloud has a free plan and paid plans for scale. The hosted MCP server uses OAuth on Cloud; self-hosted instances use the local MCP server.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams replacing Firebase who want functions, hosting and messaging as well as auth and data.
- Flutter and native mobile developers, who get first-party SDKs.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want SQL and PostgreSQL at the centre. [Supabase](/apps/supabase/) is built on Postgres.
- You want the smallest thing that works. [PocketBase](/apps/pocketbase/) is one executable.

## How it compares

| | Appwrite | [Supabase](/apps/supabase/) | [PocketBase](/apps/pocketbase/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Services | Auth, databases, storage, functions, sites, messaging, realtime | Postgres, auth, APIs, realtime, functions, storage, vectors | Database, auth, files, realtime |
| Self-host | Docker installer | Docker Compose | One executable |
| Licence | BSD-3-Clause | Apache-2.0 | MIT |
