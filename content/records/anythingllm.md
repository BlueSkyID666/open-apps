bestFor:
  - A private "ChatGPT over our documents" for a team, with per-user permissions.
  - Running entirely on one computer with a local model and the built-in vector database.
  - Swapping model, embedder and vector database providers without changing tools.
whyListed:
  - One of the most established open-source AI workspaces — public since June 2023, MIT, frequent
    releases.
  - Works fully locally by default — built-in embedder and LanceDB — and connects to dozens of model
    providers when you want them.
  - Agents, MCP, scheduled tasks and a developer API in the same app.
caveats:
  - Anonymous usage telemetry is on by default; turn it off in Privacy settings or with
    DISABLE_TELEMETRY.
  - Multi-user accounts, permissions and the embeddable chat widget are only in the Docker version,
    not the desktop app.

AnythingLLM is the safe default for "a private ChatGPT over our own documents": MIT-licensed, public since 2023, available as a desktop app for macOS, Windows and Linux and as a multi-user Docker server, and able to run entirely on one machine with a local model. It has grown well beyond document chat into agents, flows and scheduled tasks. Two defaults to change on day one: telemetry is on, and team features need the Docker version. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v1.16.2.

## What it does

Create a workspace, drop in PDFs, text or Word files, and chat with them; answers cite their sources. Around that core sit AI agents that can browse the web, a no-code agent-flow builder, MCP compatibility, scheduled tasks on a cron, memories the model keeps about you or a workspace, and dynamic routing that sends each chat to the provider and model your rules pick. A full developer API covers custom integrations.

Everything is swappable. Models can be any llama.cpp-compatible local model, Ollama, LM Studio, LocalAI or dozens of hosted providers. The embedder defaults to a built-in one, and the vector database defaults to LanceDB, with PGVector, Chroma, Qdrant, Weaviate, Milvus and others available.

## Desktop or Docker

| | Desktop app | Docker |
|---|---|---|
| Users | One | Many, with permissions |
| Embeddable website chat widget | No | Yes |
| Where it runs | Your computer | Any server or cloud |

Pick the desktop app for yourself, the Docker image for a team. A bare-metal install without Docker is documented too.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams that want a self-hosted document assistant with accounts and permissions.
- Individuals who want document chat and agents fully offline.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want an agent that works on files in folders on your computer. See [open-source Claude Cowork alternatives](/collections/open-source-claude-cowork-alternatives/).
- You want a lighter self-hosted chat interface with isolated work environments. [Libre WebUI](/apps/libre-webui/) is smaller and newer.

## How it compares

| | AnythingLLM | [Libre WebUI](/apps/libre-webui/) | [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | Documents, agents, multi-user | Chat, artifacts, isolated work | Agents on local files |
| Telemetry | On by default, opt-out | None in the app | Not described in the README |
| Licence | MIT | Apache-2.0 | MIT app, commercial `ee/` |

## Privacy and licence

The code is MIT. Mintplex Labs collects anonymous usage events — installation type, document added or removed with no document details, which vector database and model provider are in use — until you disable it in the sidebar's Privacy settings or set `DISABLE_TELEMETRY=true`. More MIT apps are in [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).
