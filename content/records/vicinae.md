bestFor:
  - Bringing a Raycast workflow to Linux, extensions included.
  - A fast native launcher with clipboard history, snippets and window switching built in.
  - dmenu-style menus for Linux scripting.
whyListed:
  - Runs many Raycast extensions and script commands without changes, and lists the Raycast store in
    the app.
  - Native C++ and Qt, not Electron.
caveats:
  - Created in July 2025 and still pre-1.0; releases are frequent.
  - Not every Raycast extension works — the project says "many", not all.
  - It describes itself as Raycast-compatible rather than as an alternative; it is listed here for
    that compatibility.

Vicinae is the answer for Linux users who miss Raycast: a native command palette that runs many Raycast extensions and script commands as they are, with the Raycast store integrated in the app. Raycast itself ships for macOS and Windows, not Linux, which is exactly the gap Vicinae was built for — its site says "Bring your macOS workflow to Linux." It is GPL-3.0, written in C++ with Qt, and now also has macOS and Windows builds. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v0.29.0.

## What it does

Out of the box Vicinae covers app search, clipboard history, snippets (a text expander), file search, a browser tab switcher, an emoji picker, a calculator, window and workspace switching, a font browser and volume control. Beyond that, three ways to extend it:

- **React and TypeScript extensions**, compatible with the Raycast ecosystem, installable from the Vicinae store or the Raycast store.
- **Script commands**, compatible with Raycast's feature of the same name, with Vicinae additions.
- **dmenu-style menus**, for the minimalist Linux way of building pickers from shell scripts.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Linux desktop users coming from Raycast on a Mac.
- Anyone who wants Raycast's extension ecosystem without Raycast's account and paid tiers.

**Look elsewhere**

- You need every Raycast extension to work; some depend on macOS-only APIs.
- You want the longest track record on Windows. [Flow Launcher](/apps/flow-launcher/) has been Windows-only and mature since 2020.

## How it compares

| | Vicinae | [Wox](/apps/wox/) | [Flow Launcher](/apps/flow-launcher/) | [Sol](/apps/sol/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Built first for | Linux | All three platforms | Windows | macOS |
| Raycast extensions | Many run as-is | No | No | No |
| Licence | GPL-3.0 | GPL-3.0 | MIT | MIT |
