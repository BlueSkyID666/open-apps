summary: A browser-based design and prototyping platform with components, variants, native design

bestFor:
  - Product teams moving interface design and prototyping off Figma onto software they can host.
  - Design systems that need design tokens, components and variants shared with developers.
  - Handing designs to developers as CSS, SVG and HTML, or to AI tools through MCP.
whyListed:
  - A repository dating back to 2015, a large community and regular releases.
  - The whole platform is MPL-2.0 and runs in the browser or on your own servers.
  - Built on open standards — SVG, CSS, HTML and JSON — rather than a proprietary file format.
caveats:
  - Organisation governance — an Admin Console, advanced permissions and SSO through your identity
    provider — comes with the paid Penpot Enterprise plan, on cloud or self-hosted.
  - The official Docker Compose file turns on anonymous telemetry; set `PENPOT_TELEMETRY_ENABLED` to
    false to stop it.

Penpot is the established open-source choice for interface design and prototyping: a browser-based platform, MPL-2.0 throughout, that you can use on Penpot's cloud or deploy on your own servers. Its maker positions it directly against Figma, and it covers the core of that job — components, variants, design tokens, flexible layouts and developer handoff — while keeping designs in open formats. The paid Enterprise plan is about organisation governance. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 2.18.0.

## What it does

- **Design and prototype** in the browser, alone or in real time with your team.
- **Design systems** with components, variants and native design tokens, so design and code share one source of truth.
- **Layouts that behave like code**, using CSS Grid and Flex Layout.
- **Developer handoff** through an inspect tab that gives SVG, CSS and HTML.
- **Programmable workspace** — a plugin system, webhooks, an API with access tokens, and an MCP server that lets AI tools read and work with designs.

Penpot works with open standards — SVG, CSS, HTML and JSON — so designs are not locked into a proprietary file format.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Product and design teams that want their design files on infrastructure they control, for compliance or cost.
- Teams where developers work closely with designers and want tokens and layouts expressed as code.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want an AI agent to generate prototypes, decks and videos from a prompt. [OpenDesign](/apps/open-design/) is built around that.
- You need a quick sketch or whiteboard rather than a design tool. [Excalidraw](/apps/excalidraw/) is lighter.

## How it compares

| | Penpot | [OpenDesign](/apps/open-design/) | [Excalidraw](/apps/excalidraw/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Job | Interface design and prototyping | AI agents that produce designs | Hand-drawn whiteboard |
| Self-host | Docker, Kubernetes | Local-first desktop and web app | Docker |
| Licence | MPL-2.0 | Apache-2.0 | MIT |

More options are in [open-source Figma alternatives](/collections/open-source-figma-alternatives/). Other weak-copyleft software is under [MPL-2.0 apps](/licenses/mpl-2.0/).

## Licence in practice

The repository is MPL-2.0, copyright Kaleidos. Penpot Enterprise is a paid plan for cloud and self-hosted use that adds organisations, an Admin Console, advanced permissions and SSO on top of the open-source platform; Penpot's documentation describes the platform itself as free and unlimited. On a self-hosted instance, the telemetry setting in the official Docker Compose file is on — a periodic process sends anonymous instance data — and can be switched off with one variable.
