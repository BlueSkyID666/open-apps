tags:

bestFor:
  - Spreadsheet users who need structure, references between tables and fine-grained access rules.
  - Formulas written in Python, with the standard library available.
  - Keeping each document as a portable SQLite file you can back up and move.
whyListed:
  - grist-core is Apache-2.0, and a grist-oss Docker image contains only open-source code.
  - In development since 2020, with release v1.7.19 in September 2026 and heavy contributions from
    French government teams.
  - Telemetry is off by default.
caveats:
  - Open-core — audit log streaming, advanced admin controls, the newer Grist Assistant, automations,
    OAuth apps, the built-in MCP server and SSO are in the paid full edition.
  - The default gristlabs/grist image includes that proprietary code, inactive until enabled; use
    gristlabs/grist-oss for open-source code only.
  - Columns hold one type of data each, which the README warns can confuse people coming from Excel.

Grist is the spreadsheet-first option among open-source Airtable alternatives: a relational spreadsheet with typed columns, Python formulas and linked widgets, stored as a portable SQLite file. Its site invites Airtable users to compare, and it imports directly from Airtable. The core is Apache-2.0, and the README lists exactly which features are in the paid edition. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v1.7.19.

## What it does

- **Formulas.** Full Python syntax with the standard library, many Excel functions, and an AI Formula Assistant that works with OpenAI-compatible endpoints and OpenRouter.
- **Structure.** References and two-way references between tables, choice lists, attachments and conditional formatting.
- **Dashboards.** Charts, card views, a calendar widget and summary tables, laid out as linked widgets.
- **Forms.** Native forms that write straight into a table.
- **Access and collaboration.** Rules for individual rows, columns and tables; comments, suggested changes and live presence.
- **Integration.** A REST API, webhooks, Zapier, SCIM and import from Excel, CSV, Google Drive and Airtable.
- **Sandboxing.** gVisor, macOS native sandboxing or a Wasm sandbox for untrusted documents.

Grist also comes as `grist-desktop`, a local app for Linux, macOS and Windows, and `grist-static`, for showing spreadsheets on a website without a server.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Analysts and small organisations that outgrew spreadsheets but still think in formulas.
- Public-sector teams — French government bodies contribute heavily to it.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want Airtable's app-builder side. [Baserow](/apps/baserow/) publishes apps and portals.
- You want a PostgreSQL back end you can query directly. [Teable](/apps/teable/) is built on it.

## How it compares

| | Grist | [Baserow](/apps/baserow/) | [Teable](/apps/teable/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Model | Relational spreadsheet | No-code database and apps | Spreadsheet-style database |
| Formulas | Python and Excel-style | Spreadsheet formulas | Spreadsheet formulas |
| Desktop app | Yes | No | No |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 core | MIT core | AGPL-3.0 core |

More options are in [open-source Airtable alternatives](/collections/open-source-airtable-alternatives/). More Apache-licensed software is under [Apache-2.0 apps](/licenses/apache-2.0/).

## Licence in practice

`grist-core`, `grist-desktop` and `grist-static` are Apache-2.0. Grist Labs sells a full edition that adds GristConnect, an Azure storage back end, audit log streaming, advanced admin controls, the newer Grist Assistant, invite and change notifications, automations, OAuth apps, a built-in MCP server and SSO through OIDC or SAML. The default `gristlabs/grist` image carries that source-available code, inert until an admin enables it; the `gristlabs/grist-oss` image contains only open-source code. `GRIST_TELEMETRY_LEVEL` defaults to off.
