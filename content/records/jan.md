bestFor:
  - Chatting with an open model on your own laptop, with no account and no internet connection.
  - Trying models from Hugging Face without the command line.
  - Giving other local tools an OpenAI-compatible endpoint at localhost:1337.
whyListed:
  - Describes itself as an open-source ChatGPT alternative and runs fully offline.
  - Installers for macOS, Windows and Linux, plus the Microsoft Store and Flathub.
  - Product analytics are off until you allow them at first launch.
caveats:
  - Local models need real hardware — the README suggests 8 GB of RAM for 3B models, 16 GB for 7B and
    32 GB for 13B.
  - A single-user desktop app; there are no shared accounts or team administration.

Jan is the simplest way to have a ChatGPT-style assistant that never leaves your computer: install it on macOS, Windows or Linux, download an open model from inside the app, and chat offline. It is Apache-2.0, public since August 2023, and asks before collecting any usage analytics. What it is not is a team server — it is one person's desktop app. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v0.8.4.

## What it does

Jan downloads and runs open models — the README names Llama, Gemma, Qwen and gpt-oss — from Hugging Face, using a bundled llama.cpp engine built for CPU, Vulkan, Metal, CUDA or ROCm. When a local model is not enough, you can connect cloud models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, Groq, MiniMax and others with your own keys.

Beyond chat:

- **Custom assistants** with their own instructions for specific tasks.
- **MCP** support for tools and agent-style use.
- **A local API server** at `localhost:1337` that speaks the OpenAI API, so other apps on your machine can use the model Jan is running.

## Privacy

Jan's privacy page says nothing is collected until you choose at first launch, and the choice can be changed in Settings. When allowed, it counts active users and retention against a random ID; it states it does not log chats, prompts, files or model choices. Cloud models, of course, see whatever you send them.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Individuals who want private, offline AI chat without running a server.
- Developers who want a local OpenAI-compatible endpoint with a graphical model manager.

**Look elsewhere**

- You need one chat service for a whole team with logins and roles. [LibreChat](/apps/librechat/) is built for multi-user self-hosting.
- You want answers grounded in a library of your documents. [AnythingLLM](/apps/anythingllm/) is organised around document workspaces.

## How it compares

| | Jan | [LibreChat](/apps/librechat/) | [AnythingLLM](/apps/anythingllm/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Form | Desktop app | Self-hosted web app | Desktop app or Docker server |
| Runs models itself | Yes (llama.cpp) | No — connects to Ollama or APIs | Yes, or via Ollama |
| Multi-user | No | Yes | Docker version |
| Analytics | Off until allowed | Operator-configured | On by default, can be disabled |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 | MIT | MIT |

## Licence in practice

GitHub does not detect a licence because the LICENSE file adds a copyright header and a line requesting attribution in user-facing materials; the text itself is the Apache License 2.0, and the README says "Apache 2.0". The repository was previously under `menloresearch/jan`, which now redirects to `janhq/jan`. Contributors are asked to sign their commits.
