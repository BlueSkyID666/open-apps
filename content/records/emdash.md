summary: A desktop app for running several coding agents in parallel — Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode,
  Amp and more — each in its own Git worktree, then reviewing diffs, opening pull requests, checking
  CI and merging from one window, locally or over SSH.

  coding agents in parallel. Use any provider.

bestFor:
  - Trying several fixes or features at once with different agents and keeping the best diff.
  - Sending a Linear, GitHub or Jira ticket straight to an agent.
  - Running the same parallel workflow on a remote machine over SSH.
whyListed:
  - Works with the agent CLIs you already use and detects installed ones automatically.
  - Local-first — app state in a local SQLite database, no code or chats sent to Emdash servers.
caveats:
  - Sends optional telemetry, which you can turn off in Settings or by launching with
    `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`.
  - For agents with lifecycle hooks, Emdash writes marker-tagged entries into the agent's user-level
    config to track status and sessions.
  - It orchestrates agents rather than being one; you still need Claude Code, Codex or another agent
    CLI and its account.

Emdash solves the problem that appears once you use coding agents daily: running several at once without a mess of terminals and branches. Each task gets its own Git worktree and branch, the agent of your choice works in it, and you review the diffs, open a pull request, watch CI and merge from the same window. It is an Apache-2.0 desktop app from a Y Combinator W26 company, for macOS, Windows and Linux. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v1.2.7.

## What it does

- **Parallel agents.** Run multiple tasks at once, each isolated in its own worktree and branch.
- **Bring your agents.** Detects installed CLIs — Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, OpenCode, Amp, Devin, Qwen Code, Droid, GitHub Copilot and others — and tracks status and resumable sessions through their hooks.
- **Tickets in.** Send issues from Linear, GitHub, Jira, GitLab, Asana, Featurebase, Monday.com, Forgejo or Plain to an agent.
- **Review and ship.** Diffs, pull requests, CI checks and merge in one place.
- **Remote projects.** Connect over SSH/SFTP with agent, key or password auth; credentials go in the OS keychain.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Developers already using Claude Code, Codex or [OpenCode](/apps/opencode/) who want to run several tasks side by side.
- Anyone who wants to compare what different agents do with the same ticket.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a single agent inside your editor — see [Cline](/apps/cline/).
- You want agents in tabbed workspaces with an editor, terminal and browser — see [NextCoWork](/apps/nextcowork/); for agent sessions that survive on an always-on host, see [opendray](/apps/opendray/).

## Privacy

App state is stored locally in SQLite, and Emdash says it does not send your code or chats to its servers; the agent CLIs send context to their own providers. Telemetry is optional and can be disabled in Settings or with `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false`. More Apache-licensed tools are under [Apache-2.0 apps](/licenses/apache-2.0/).
