    access control are enterprise features, in submodules outside this repository.
  - Telemetry is enabled by default; set DISABLE_TOOLJET_TELEMETRY to turn it off.
  - The README's quick-start Docker image is tagged ee-lts-latest, the enterprise build.

ToolJet is a full internal-tool builder with its own database, and it answers "Is ToolJet a Retool alternative that I can self-host for free?" with "Yes" on its comparison page. The repository describes itself as the open-source foundation of ToolJet AI: the Community Edition is AGPL and complete for visual building, while AI generation, workflows and governance features sit in the paid edition. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v3.20.233-lts.

## What it does

**Community Edition**

- **Visual app builder** with 80+ components — tables, charts, forms, lists and more — and multi-page apps.
- **ToolJet Database**, a built-in no-code database.
- **90+ data sources** across databases, APIs, cloud storage and SaaS tools.
- **JavaScript and Python** inside apps.
- **Multiplayer editing**, inline comments and mentions, and granular access control.
- **Plugins and connectors** through the ToolJet CLI.
- **Security**: AES-256-GCM encryption, proxy-only data flow and SSO support.

**Beyond the Community Edition**, the ToolJet AI edition adds app generation from prompts, an AI query builder, an agent builder, workflows, modules, audit logs, SCIM, multiple environments, GitSync and white-labelling. The MCP server, which lets Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build or Cursor build apps, is in beta.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams building operational apps that span several databases and SaaS tools.
- Organisations that want a self-hosted builder and may later buy enterprise governance.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want every feature under a permissive licence. [Appsmith](/apps/appsmith/) is Apache-2.0.
- You need workflow automation without a paid plan. [Budibase](/apps/budibase/) includes automations in its open-source plan.

## How it compares

| | ToolJet | [Appsmith](/apps/appsmith/) | [Budibase](/apps/budibase/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Built-in database | ToolJet Database | No | Budibase data tables |
| Hosted option | ToolJet Cloud | Appsmith Cloud | Budibase Cloud |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0, enterprise submodules | Apache-2.0 | GPL-3.0, BSL pro package |

The full comparison is in [open-source Retool alternatives](/collections/open-source-retool-alternatives/).

## Licence in practice

The repository is AGPL-3.0. Enterprise code lives in two Git submodules, `frontend/ee` and `server/ee`, that point to separate ToolJet repositories. The Community Edition sends telemetry to ToolJet every 24 hours unless `DISABLE_TOOLJET_TELEMETRY=true` is set. More AGPL software is under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).
