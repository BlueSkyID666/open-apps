bestFor:
  - Support teams that want SLAs, assignment rules and a customer portal without a per-agent bill.
  - Companies already running ERPNext or other Frappe apps.
  - A self-hosted knowledge base next to the ticket queue.
whyListed:
  - Built and used by Frappe, the company behind ERPNext, since 2021, with regular releases.
  - The whole app is AGPL-3.0 and installs in one script on a server of your own.
caveats:
  - It does not describe itself as a Zendesk alternative; it is listed with them because it covers
    the same ticketing, SLA and help-centre job.
  - It runs on the Frappe Framework, so upgrades and customisation follow Frappe's bench tooling
    and version compatibility.

Frappe Helpdesk is a ticket management app from Frappe, the company behind ERPNext, built because their own support team outgrew ERPNext's support module. It covers the structured side of customer service — SLAs, assignment rules, a customer portal and a knowledge base — rather than live chat, and it is the natural pick if you already run Frappe software. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v1.30.1.

## What it does

- **Agent and customer portals.** Customers submit and follow tickets in their own view; agents work the queue in theirs.
- **Customisable SLAs** to set and track response times.
- **Assignment rules** that route tickets automatically by priority, issue type or workload.
- **A knowledge base** of help articles, with search that suggests relevant articles to customers as they describe an issue.
- **Saved replies** for common questions.

The front end is built with Frappe UI, a Vue library, on top of the Python and JavaScript Frappe Framework. The current main branch works with Frappe Framework versions 15 and 16.

## Running it

For production, Frappe publishes an easy-install script that deploys a Docker-based instance in about five minutes, given your email and domain. There is a Docker Compose setup for development and trials, and a manual `bench` install. Frappe Cloud, Frappe's managed hosting, is the hosted option.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams with structured support: tickets, SLAs, routing and a help centre.
- Companies already on ERPNext or Frappe CRM.

**Look elsewhere**

- Your customers mostly reach you through website chat or WhatsApp. [Chatwoot](/apps/chatwoot/) is built for that.
- You want the longest-established standalone helpdesk. [Zammad](/apps/zammad/) has been developed since 2012.

## How it compares

| | Frappe Helpdesk | [Zammad](/apps/zammad/) | [FreeScout](/apps/freescout/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | SLAs, routing, portal, knowledge base | Multi-channel ticketing | Shared mailbox |
| Platform | Frappe Framework | Standalone Rails app | Standalone PHP app |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0, paid modules |
