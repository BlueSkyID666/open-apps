Vikunja is the to-do app for people who want Todoist's ease on their own server. It organises tasks in projects and subprojects, shows them as a list, a Gantt chart, a table or a Kanban board, and imports your existing tasks from Todoist, Trello or Microsoft To-Do. It is AGPL-3.0, ships as a single binary or a Docker image, and has a hosted Vikunja Cloud if you would rather not run it. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v2.6.0.

## What it does

- **Projects and subprojects** to group related work, shared with other users or whole teams, with assignees.
- **Four views** — list, Gantt, table and Kanban — over the same tasks.
- **Reminders, due dates, repeating tasks and subtasks.**
- **Quick Add Magic** — type a task with a date, labels or assignees in one line and Vikunja fills in the fields.
- **Migration** from Todoist, Trello and Microsoft To-Do.
- **An OpenAPI-documented REST API** for scripts and other clients.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Self-hosters and households who want a private to-do list they can reach from any browser.
- Small teams that need boards and lists without a full project management suite.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a board-first tool with swimlanes and WIP limits. [WeKan](/apps/wekan/) and [Kanboard](/apps/kanboard/) focus on Kanban.
- You need sprints, portfolios and time tracking for a larger organisation. [OpenProject](/apps/openproject/) covers it.

## How it compares

| | Vikunja | [WeKan](/apps/wekan/) | [Kanboard](/apps/kanboard/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Views | List, Gantt, table, Kanban | Kanban boards with swimlanes | Kanban board |
| Importers | Todoist, Trello, Microsoft To-Do | Trello, Jira, Asana, CSV and more | Not a focus |
| Stack | Go and Vue | Meteor, MongoDB | PHP |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 | MIT | MIT |

More boards are in [open-source Trello alternatives](/collections/open-source-trello-alternatives/). More AGPL software is under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).

## Licence in practice

Most of the repository is AGPL-3.0-or-later; the `desktop/` wrapper is GPL-3.0-or-later. Vikunja Cloud is the maintainers' hosted service, and Vikunja Pro — an admin panel, audit logs and time tracking for instances you host yourself — was in private beta when checked.
