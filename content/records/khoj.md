Khoj is the pick when you want Perplexity-style answers from your own knowledge as well as the web: it indexes your documents — PDFs, Markdown, Org-mode, Word and Notion files — searches the internet, and answers with any local or online model. It reaches you wherever you work, from a browser to Obsidian, Emacs, a phone or WhatsApp, and it self-hosts under AGPL-3.0. The thing to know: its last tagged release is a beta from March, and the team is now also building another product. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 2.0.0-beta.28.

## What it does

Chat with a local model such as Llama, Qwen, Gemma or Mistral, or an online one such as GPT, Claude, Gemini or DeepSeek. Khoj pulls answers from the internet and from the documents you connect, with advanced semantic search to find the right passage. **Agents** combine custom knowledge, a persona, a chat model and tools for a given role. **Automations** run repetitive research on a schedule and deliver it as personal newsletters or notifications. It can also generate images and read messages aloud.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Knowledge workers with large note collections in Obsidian, Emacs Org-mode or Notion.
- People who want web research and document search in one self-hosted assistant.

**Look elsewhere**

- You only want web answers with citations, set up in a minute. [Vane](/apps/vane/) is one Docker command.
- You want a polished multi-user search app with share links. [Morphic](/apps/morphic/) fits better.

## How it compares

| | Khoj | [Vane](/apps/vane/) | [Morphic](/apps/morphic/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Your documents | Indexed and searched | File uploads per question | File uploads |
| Clients | Browser, Obsidian, Emacs, desktop, phone, WhatsApp | Browser | Browser |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 | MIT | Apache-2.0 |

All three are compared in [open-source Perplexity alternatives](/collections/open-source-perplexity-alternatives/). More AGPL software is under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).

## Licence and hosting

AGPL-3.0: self-host and modify freely; publish your changes if you run a modified Khoj for others over a network. Khoj also runs a cloud app and sells enterprise deployments — cloud, on-premises or hybrid — alongside the open code.
