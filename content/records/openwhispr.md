bestFor:
  - One app for dictation and meeting transcripts on Windows, Mac or Linux.
  - Offline dictation with Whisper or Parakeet on your own hardware.
  - Transcribing existing audio and video files with speaker labels.
whyListed:
  - Dictation, meeting recording, notes and an AI assistant in one MIT-licensed desktop app.
  - Every core feature can run on local models; cloud providers are optional.
  - Builds for macOS (Apple Silicon and Intel), Windows and Linux on every release.
caveats:
  - OpenWhispr Cloud is a paid service beside the app — the free plan has unlimited local dictation
    and a weekly cloud-word allowance; Pro, Business and Enterprise plans lift the limits.
  - On Intel Macs, live speaker identification and voice fingerprinting are unavailable, according
    to the README.
  - An Electron app, so heavier than the Tauri dictation tools.

OpenWhispr is the broadest of the open-source voice apps: hotkey dictation into any app, meeting transcription with speaker labels, notes, file transcription and a voice assistant, in one MIT-licensed desktop app for macOS, Windows and Linux. Speech can stay on your machine with Whisper or Parakeet, or go to a cloud provider with your own key. The company behind it sells OpenWhispr Cloud plans, which you do not need for local use. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v1.10.2.

## What it does

- **Dictation.** Press a global hotkey, speak, and the text is pasted at your cursor. A second hotkey dictates in one language and pastes in another.
- **Meetings.** It detects Zoom, Teams and FaceTime calls, transcribes with on-device speaker diarization and voice fingerprints, and connects to Google, Microsoft or Apple calendars.
- **Notes and files.** Notes with folders and semantic search; drag in audio or video, batch-upload, or paste a YouTube URL to transcribe it.
- **Assistant.** A voice assistant hotkey sends what you say to GPT, Claude, Gemini, Groq, OpenRouter or a local model, and can edit highlighted text in place.
- **API and MCP.** A public API and an MCP server let other tools read notes and transcriptions.

Local speech runs through whisper.cpp and sherpa-onnx, with GPU acceleration on Metal, CUDA and Vulkan. The README says there is no data collection and no telemetry.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- People who want dictation and meeting notes without paying for two subscriptions.
- Linux users — builds ship as AppImage, .deb, .rpm and tar.gz.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a small, dictation-only tool: [Handy](/apps/handy/) is lighter.
- You want meetings stored as plain Markdown for your agents: [Minutes](/apps/minutes/).

## How it compares

| | OpenWhispr | [Handy](/apps/handy/) | [Voquill](/apps/voquill/) | [Minutes](/apps/minutes/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Dictation into any app | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| Meeting transcription | Yes, with speaker labels | — | — | Yes |
| Platforms | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows (CLI on Linux) |
| Licence | MIT | MIT | AGPL-3.0 plus enterprise code | MIT |

## Licence in practice

The whole repository is MIT. OpenWhispr Cloud — hosted transcription, more meeting hours and team tools — is a paid service; its pricing page lists Pro at $8 a month and Business at $16 per user a month, with local dictation free on every plan. More MIT apps are under [MIT apps](/licenses/mit/).
