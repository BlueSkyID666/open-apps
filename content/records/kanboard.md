tags:

bestFor:
  - A personal or small-team Kanban board that stays out of the way.
  - Running on modest hardware with SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL.
  - Teams that want a stable, finished tool rather than a stream of new features.
whyListed:
  - MIT-licensed, in development since 2014, with regular releases.
  - Automatic actions change assignees, colours and categories when events happen.
  - LDAP or Active Directory and any OAuth2 provider for login.
caveats:
  - In maintenance mode — the author is not building major new features; releases come from
    community contributions and small fixes.
  - It does not describe itself as a Trello alternative; it is listed with them as a self-hosted
    Kanban board. The interface is intentionally plain.

Kanboard is the minimalist's Kanban board: a small PHP application, MIT-licensed since 2014, that does boards, tasks and automation and deliberately stops there. Its author calls it complete — it is in maintenance mode, so expect fixes and community contributions rather than new features — which is exactly why some teams choose it. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v1.2.54.

## What it does

- **A Kanban board** with drag-and-drop tasks and columns you can add, rename and remove at any time.
- **Work-in-progress limits** that highlight a column when it is over the limit.
- **Search and filters** through a simple query language — by assignee, description, category, due date and more.
- **Tasks** with subtasks, time or complexity estimates, Markdown descriptions, comments, attachments and colours, and one-click moves or copies across projects.
- **Automatic actions** that change the assignee, colour, category and other fields when events happen.
- **Authentication** through LDAP or Active Directory, or any OAuth2 provider such as Google, GitHub or GitLab.
- **Plugins** to extend it, and translations in 30+ languages.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Individuals and small teams who want a board, not a platform.
- Self-hosters on low-powered servers who value stability over new features.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want real-time collaboration and imports from Trello. [WeKan](/apps/wekan/) is closer to Trello.
- You want lists, Gantt and reminders as well as a board. [Vikunja](/apps/vikunja/) has four views.

## How it compares

| | Kanboard | [WeKan](/apps/wekan/) | [Vikunja](/apps/vikunja/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Development | Maintenance mode | Frequent releases | Frequent releases |
| Stack | PHP | Meteor, MongoDB | Go and Vue |
| Views | Kanban board | Kanban with swimlanes | List, Gantt, table, Kanban |
| Licence | MIT | MIT | AGPL-3.0 |

More boards are in [open-source Trello alternatives](/collections/open-source-trello-alternatives/). More permissive software is under [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).
