summary: An Electron desktop app that gives an AI agent a workspace folder, document skills and MCP
  connectors, and runs its shell commands inside a WSL2 or Lima virtual machine when one is
  available.

tags:

  - productivity

bestFor:
  - Windows users who want agent file work with commands confined to a WSL2 Linux VM.
  - Producing slides, documents and spreadsheets from files in a folder.
  - Driving the agent remotely from Feishu (Lark).
whyListed:
  - Routes shell commands through a local VM automatically when WSL2 or Lima is installed.
  - Works with Anthropic, OpenRouter and OpenAI-compatible endpoints, including GLM, MiniMax and Kimi.
caveats:
  - The bundled document skills (docx, pdf, pptx, xlsx) are Anthropic's, with a licence file reading
    "All rights reserved" — they are not covered by the repository's MIT licence.
  - The last tagged release is v3.3.1 from May 2026; development continues on main.
  - Builds cover Apple Silicon Macs and x64 Windows only. The Homebrew cask installs with
    --no-quarantine, which skips Gatekeeper.
  - Without WSL2 or Lima, commands run natively with path restrictions only.

Open Cowork is the Claude Cowork alternative with the most careful answer to "what if the agent runs the wrong command?": on Windows it sends every shell command into a WSL2 Linux VM, on a Mac into a Lima VM, and only falls back to running natively when neither is installed. It is MIT-licensed and easy to install. Two things to weigh: the document skills it ships are Anthropic's proprietary skills, and the last tagged release is from May. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v3.3.1.

## What it does

You choose a workspace folder, paste an API key, and ask for an outcome — "read the CSV in this folder and make a five-slide summary". The agent reads and writes files in that folder, uses built-in skills to produce PPTX, DOCX, XLSX and PDF output, and reaches other apps through MCP connectors such as a browser or Notion. A trace panel shows its reasoning and tool calls as they happen. It can also be driven from Feishu (Lark), and it can operate desktop GUI apps; the README recommends a Gemini model for that.

Under the hood it is an Electron app using the Pi coding agent packages, with support for Anthropic, OpenRouter and OpenAI-compatible APIs.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Windows users who already have WSL2 and want the agent kept out of their host system.
- Office-document work driven from files in one folder.

**Look elsewhere**

- You are on Linux or an Intel Mac — there is no build. [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) and [Eigent](/apps/eigent/) ship Linux builds.
- You need everything you install to be open source. See the licence section below.
- You want a local model with no API key. The quick start assumes a hosted provider; [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) documents Ollama.

## How it compares

| | Open Cowork | [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) | [NextCoWork](/apps/nextcowork/) | [OpenWorker](/apps/openworker/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Command isolation | WSL2 / Lima VM | Not described in the README | Per-call approval | Approval gates, optional container sandbox |
| Platforms | Apple Silicon Mac, Windows | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows |
| Licence | MIT, Anthropic skills bundled | MIT app, commercial `ee/` | Apache-2.0 | MIT |

## Licence in practice

The application code is MIT. The four document skills in `.claude/skills/` — `docx`, `pdf`, `pptx` and `xlsx` — each carry a `LICENSE.txt` that reads "© 2025 Anthropic, PBC. All rights reserved" and points to Anthropic's consumer or commercial terms. If you fork or redistribute Open Cowork, those directories are not yours to relicense; replace them or check Anthropic's terms. The `skill-creator` skill and your own skills are unaffected. Other MIT apps are listed under [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).

## Running it

Download the Apple Silicon `.dmg` or the Windows `.exe` from the releases page, or `brew install --cask --no-quarantine open-cowork` after tapping `OpenCoworkAI/tap`. For the sandbox, install WSL2 on Windows or `brew install lima` on a Mac before first use; Open Cowork detects either and creates its own VM.
