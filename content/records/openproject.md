bestFor:
  - Organisations replacing Jira or MS Project with a self-hosted tool they control.
  - Mixed teams that need both agile boards and classic Gantt scheduling in one place.
  - Public institutions and regulated industries that must keep project data on their own servers.
whyListed:
  - In development since 2012, with a large community and monthly releases.
  - Covers portfolios, agile and classic planning, time and cost tracking in the free Community
    edition.
  - Integrates with Nextcloud, XWiki, GitHub and GitLab.
caveats:
  - Enterprise add-ons and support come with the paid Enterprise edition, which upgrades a
    self-hosted Community edition with a licence key.
  - A large Ruby on Rails application with PostgreSQL; OpenProject's system requirements scale CPU
    and memory with the number of concurrent users.

OpenProject is the heavyweight among open-source Jira alternatives: a GPL-3.0 platform, in development since 2012, that covers project portfolios, agile boards, Gantt scheduling, roadmaps, time and cost tracking, wikis and meeting minutes. It describes itself as an enterprise-ready alternative to Jira, MS Project, Monday, Asana and YouTrack, and it is built for organisations that must keep project data on their own infrastructure. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v17.8.0.

## What it does

- **Project and portfolio management** across many projects.
- **Agile boards** for Kanban, Scrum and SAFe, alongside **Gantt charts** for classic scheduling.
- **Product and release planning** with roadmaps.
- **Work packages** for tasks and bugs, with team collaboration around them.
- **Time tracking, cost reporting and budgeting.**
- **Wikis, forums, news, and meeting agendas and minutes.**
- **Integrations** with Nextcloud, XWiki, GitHub, GitLab and more.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Companies and public bodies moving off Jira or MS Project that need portfolio views, budgets and on-premises hosting.
- Teams that run agile and waterfall projects side by side.

**Look elsewhere**

- A software team that wants a fast, modern issue tracker. [Plane](/apps/plane/) is closer to Linear and Jira Software.
- A small team that wants something simple to run and learn. [Leantime](/apps/leantime/) is aimed at non-project managers.

## How it compares

| | OpenProject | [Plane](/apps/plane/) | [Leantime](/apps/leantime/) | [Taiga](/apps/taiga/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | Portfolio, agile and classic PM | Software issue tracking | Goals and simple planning | Agile Scrum and Kanban |
| Licence | GPL-3.0, paid Enterprise add-ons | AGPL-3.0 CE, closed Commercial Edition | AGPL-3.0, enterprise plugins | MPL-2.0 and AGPL-3.0 |

The full comparison is in [open-source Jira alternatives](/collections/open-source-jira-alternatives/). More copyleft software is under [GPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/gpl-3.0/).

## Licence in practice

The code is GPL-3.0. The free Community edition is self-hosted; the Enterprise edition, on-premises or in OpenProject's cloud, adds Enterprise add-ons, extra security features and support. OpenProject says an existing Community installation can be upgraded to Enterprise on-premises, with a 14-day trial licence key.
