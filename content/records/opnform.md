OpnForm is a practical form builder for the forms most teams actually need — contact, signup, application and feedback forms, embedded anywhere, with logic and notifications. Its site presents it as "the powerful Typeform alternative", with Typeform-style or classic layouts, and it now ships an MCP server so AI agents can draft forms. The core is AGPL; a small enterprise directory is not. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v2.5.0.

## What it does

- **Builder.** No-code editing, many input types including dates, URLs and file uploads, and form logic.
- **No caps on the core.** The README lists unlimited forms and submissions.
- **Delivery.** Embed forms anywhere, send email notifications, and post to Slack, Discord or webhooks.
- **Protection and insight.** Captcha protection and form analytics.
- **AI agents.** A remote MCP server lets agents create and preview a private draft without logging in; with OAuth they can manage forms in a workspace and search, count and export submissions read-only.

The back end is Laravel and the front end Nuxt, with PostgreSQL, MySQL or SQLite as the database.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Small businesses and agencies that embed many forms on websites.
- Teams already running PHP and Laravel who want to own their form data.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want the whole repository under an open-source licence. [HeyForm](/apps/heyform/) has no enterprise directory.
- You need in-app product surveys. [Formbricks](/apps/formbricks/) targets users inside your app.

## How it compares

| | OpnForm | [HeyForm](/apps/heyform/) | [LimeSurvey](/apps/limesurvey/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | Everyday web forms | Conversational forms | Survey research |
| AI agents | MCP server | None in the README | None in the README |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 core, enterprise directory | AGPL-3.0 | GPL-2.0 or later |

More options are in [open-source Typeform alternatives](/collections/open-source-typeform-alternatives/).

## Licence in practice

The README describes a dual-licence model. The main application is AGPL-3.0 or later. Code under `api/app/Enterprise/` — which, when checked, held a single `Oidc` directory — is under OpnForm's proprietary Enterprise Licence and Enterprise Terms. If single sign-on through OpenID Connect matters to you, check how it is licensed before you plan a self-hosted rollout. More AGPL software is under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).
