summary: A self-hosted web UI for AI image and video generation that puts a beginner-friendly
  Generate tab, image editor and grid generator on top of a ComfyUI backend, with the raw ComfyUI
  graph one tab away and the option to spread work across several GPUs.

bestFor:
  - Getting ComfyUI's model support behind a simple prompt-and-generate interface.
  - Comparing prompts, models and settings side by side with the grid generator.
  - Running generation on a home server or cloud GPU and using it from a browser.
whyListed:
  - Active since 2023, first under Stability AI and since June 2024 under its original author, with
    commits in the past week.
  - Beginners and advanced users share one tool — a Generate tab and the full ComfyUI graph.
  - MIT-licensed, with no paid tier; the author funds it through donations.
caveats:
  - Still labelled beta (v0.9.8); the README calls its status "Almost-Release".
  - It depends on ComfyUI, which it installs as its backend; ComfyUI is GPL-3.0.
  - On macOS it runs only on Apple Silicon; installing needs .NET, Git and Python.

SwarmUI is the easiest way into ComfyUI's model support without starting from a node graph: you type a prompt in the Generate tab, adjust parameters, and SwarmUI builds and runs the ComfyUI workflow for you. When you need the raw graph it is in the next tab. It is MIT-licensed and still labelled beta, though its author describes it as recommended for most users. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 0.9.8-Beta, with commits in the past week.

## What it does

A C# server with a browser interface. The **Generate** tab covers prompt, model and parameters for image and video models; the README lists Stable Diffusion, Flux and Krea 2 for images, Wan, LTX-2 and MiniMax H3 for video, and some audio models such as ACE-Step. An **image editor**, automatic workflow generation and a **Grid Generator** for side-by-side comparisons sit alongside it. The **Comfy Workflow** tab exposes the full ComfyUI graph.

The name comes from its original feature: letting a "swarm" of GPUs generate for one user at once. It auto-installs ComfyUI as its backend and can also use AUTOMATIC1111's WebUI. Install scripts cover Windows, Linux and Apple Silicon Macs, and there are Docker instructions and templates for cloud GPU providers.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- People who want local generation with a straightforward interface and room to grow into ComfyUI.
- Anyone running generation on a separate GPU machine and using it from a browser.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a canvas for painting and masking. [Invoke](/apps/invokeai/) is built for that.
- You would rather work in the node graph directly. Use [ComfyUI](/apps/comfyui/) itself.

## How it compares

| | SwarmUI | [ComfyUI](/apps/comfyui/) | [Invoke](/apps/invokeai/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Main interface | Generate tab, plus a ComfyUI graph tab | Node graph | Canvas, gallery and workflows |
| Engine | ComfyUI backend | Its own | Its own |
| Status | Beta | Stable releases | Stable releases |
| Licence | MIT | GPL-3.0 | Apache-2.0 |

The three are compared side by side above; more image and video tools are under [Media](/categories/media/). More MIT software is under [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).

## Licence in practice

SwarmUI's own code is MIT (Stability AI held the copyright for work before June 2024). The README is explicit about what it pulls in: ComfyUI (GPL-3.0) as the backend, optionally AUTOMATIC1111's WebUI (AGPL-3.0), and optionally Ultralytics (AGPL-3.0) for face detection, which it warns may bring AGPL terms. Setup downloads models, and it notes that "any models used have their own licenses". Check each model's licence before commercial use.
