summary: A desktop app with a local Python agent server that delivers finished work — reports,
  documents, security reviews — across your files, terminal and 25+ connected apps, with approval
  gates and an audit trail on every tool call.

tags:

  - privacy
bestFor:
  - Security reviews of a codebase, cloud posture audits and incident write-ups.
  - Recurring work across Slack, Jira, GitHub, Gmail and similar tools, on a schedule.
  - Teams that need a record of who approved each action the agent took.
whyListed:
  - Governance is built in — hard human-only floors, approvals that can graduate into rules, and an
    audit trail with approval provenance.
  - Runs locally with any major provider or Ollama; the only cloud component brokers OAuth for
    connectors and is optional.
caveats:
  - Early-stage — the repository was created in July 2026 and the app is labelled open beta.
  - Windows builds are not yet code-signed, so SmartScreen warns on install.
  - It does not describe itself as a Claude Cowork alternative; it is listed with them because it does
    the same kind of work.

OpenWorker is an early but unusually disciplined desktop agent: the pitch is finished deliverables — a reviewed codebase with fixes ready, a report, a triaged inbox — and the design is built around never letting the agent grant itself permission. It is MIT-licensed, runs on macOS and Windows, and works with your own model key or Ollama. It is also in open beta and only a few months old, so expect rough edges. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v0.2.1.

## Governed by design

Most agents in this category ask for approval; OpenWorker makes approval the architecture. Its README describes four tiers:

1. **Hard floors** — a set of dangerous and irreversible operations always goes to a human, even in auto-approve mode.
2. **Earned autonomy** — one-off approvals can graduate into standing rules and then config allowlists, each step visible and revocable.
3. **An audit trail** — every tool call is stored with how it was approved, by whom, and why.
4. **A sandbox** — shell and file tools can run in a per-agent Linux container through NVIDIA OpenShell.

Unattended scheduled runs never approve themselves; their questions wait in an inbox.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Security work first — the first specialist "coworkers" do code security review, cloud posture checks and incident triage, combining scanners such as semgrep with model reasoning.
- People whose work is spread across Slack, Jira, GitHub, Notion, Gmail and calendars.

**Look elsewhere**

- You are on Linux — there is no build. [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) and [Eigent](/apps/eigent/) have one.
- You want a mature, long-running project. [Eigent](/apps/eigent/) has been releasing since 2025.

## How it compares

| | OpenWorker | [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/) | [Eigent](/apps/eigent/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Approach | Specialist coworkers, finished deliverables | Agent on your files, shared skills | Parallel multi-agent workforce |
| Platforms | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows, Linux |
| Licence | MIT | MIT app, commercial `ee/` | Apache-2.0 |

It sits in [open-source Claude Cowork alternatives](/collections/open-source-claude-cowork-alternatives/) as the editor's pick for governed work, not because it claims the comparison itself.

## Privacy and licence

Conversations, connector tokens and model keys live in the app's local secret store. The one cloud component brokers OAuth handshakes for connectors, and you can skip it by creating connector credentials yourself. The code is MIT with no separate commercial directory. More MIT apps are in [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).
