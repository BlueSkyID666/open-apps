bestFor:
  - Mac users who want Raycast-style built-ins — window management, clipboard, calendar, emoji — with
    no extensions to install.
  - A free, open launcher with almost no configuration.
whyListed:
  - A long list of useful utilities built in, from UUID and lorem ipsum generators to a process killer
    and Wi-Fi password lookup.
  - Maintained since 2022, with frequent releases and a Homebrew cask.
caveats:
  - macOS only.
  - No extension store; you extend it with custom AppleScript commands, links and scripts.
  - It does not describe itself as a Raycast alternative; it is listed with them for doing the same
    job on a Mac.

Sol is the Mac launcher for people who liked Raycast's built-in utilities more than its extension store. It ships a long list of small tools ready to use — app search, a window manager, clipboard history, an emoji picker, upcoming meetings in the menu bar, custom AppleScript commands and more — with almost nothing to configure. It is MIT-licensed, maintained since 2022, and built with React Native for macOS. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 2.1.362.

## What it does

Beyond app search and custom shortcuts, Sol's built-ins include Google Translate, a calendar with the next meeting in the menu bar, starting a Google Meet, a window manager, an emoji picker, a clipboard manager, a notes scratchpad, browser bookmark import, custom links and AppleScript commands, a script runner, maths evaluation, a process killer, Wi-Fi password and IP address lookup, theme switching, NanoID, UUID and lorem ipsum generators, JSON formatting, and media-key forwarding to Spotify or Apple Music.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Mac users who want a free Raycast-style launcher that works well from the first minute.
- People who prefer built-in tools over installing extensions.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want to run Raycast extensions. [Vicinae](/apps/vicinae/) supports many of them.
- You also need Windows or Linux. [Wox](/apps/wox/) runs on all three.

## How it compares

| | Sol | [Wox](/apps/wox/) | [Vicinae](/apps/vicinae/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Platforms | macOS | Windows, macOS, Linux | Linux, macOS, Windows |
| Approach | Many built-ins, little setup | Plugin store | Raycast extension compatibility |
| Licence | MIT | GPL-3.0 | GPL-3.0 |

The full comparison is in [open-source Raycast alternatives](/collections/open-source-raycast-alternatives/). Other [React Native](/stacks/react-native/) apps and [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/) are in the directory too.

## Installing it

`brew install --cask sol`, or download the latest build linked from the project site. Contributors need Xcode and a React Native for macOS setup.
