Presenton is the open-source Gamma alternative to try if the deliverable has to be a real PowerPoint file: it generates decks from a prompt, an uploaded document or your own PowerPoint design, lets you polish them by hand, and exports fully editable PPTX. It self-hosts with Docker or runs as a desktop app, works with local models through Ollama or LM Studio, and exposes a generation API. Apache-2.0. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at desktop release v0.9.11-beta.

## What it does

Start from a prompt, a document or an existing PowerPoint design; choose a built-in template — pitch deck, business report, executive update, education — or your own; generate; then edit with a drag-and-drop interface and export. Because the export is editable PPTX rather than an image or a web page, the result works in PowerPoint, Keynote or Google Slides like any other deck. The same engine is available as an API for generating presentations from other software.

Models are your choice: Ollama, LM Studio, OpenAI, Gemini, Vertex AI, Azure OpenAI, Amazon Bedrock, Fireworks, Together AI, Anthropic or any OpenAI-compatible provider.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams that present in PowerPoint and want AI drafts on their own templates.
- Organisations that cannot send internal documents to a hosted slide generator.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want Gamma's web-page-style "cards" rather than slides.
- You want a presentation framework you write by hand in Markdown; that is a different tool.

## Privacy and licence

The code is Apache-2.0. Presenton sends anonymous usage data by default; set `DISABLE_ANONYMOUS_TRACKING=true` to turn it off. With a local model and tracking disabled, nothing needs to leave your server. Other Apache-licensed apps are under [Apache-2.0 apps](/licenses/apache-2.0/), and more office tools under [Productivity](/categories/productivity/). For AI agents that also produce slides from your files, see [open-source Claude Cowork alternatives](/collections/open-source-claude-cowork-alternatives/).
