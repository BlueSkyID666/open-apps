summary: A native Mac dictation app — hold Fn, speak, and a fast hosted model transcribes and cleans
  up what you said using nearby app context and your custom vocabulary, then pastes it; an Edit Mode
  rewrites selected text by voice.

bestFor:
  - The fastest free path to Wispr Flow-style cleanup on a Mac, using a free Groq key.
  - Rewriting highlighted text by voice — "make this shorter", "turn this into bullets".
  - Spelling names and jargon correctly from the context of the app you are typing in.
whyListed:
  - Free and MIT, for Apple Silicon and Intel Macs.
  - No FreeFlow server — requests go only to the provider you configure, including local
    OpenAI-compatible servers.
caveats:
  - Cloud by default. Audio and nearby screen context go to Groq unless you point it at a local or
    self-hosted provider, which the README says is often slower.
  - macOS only.

FreeFlow is the quickest way to get Wispr Flow's feel on a Mac for free: hold Fn, talk, and cleaned-up text appears, with names and terms spelled from the context of the app you are in. It gets that speed by using a hosted model — Groq by default, with a free key — so it is not a privacy-first tool unless you point it at your own server. MIT-licensed, macOS only. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v1.2.1.

## What it does

Hold `Fn` to talk or tap `Command-Fn` to toggle. FreeFlow transcribes, then runs a cleanup pass that removes filler words, fixes grammar and punctuation, and corrects close misspellings of names it can see in nearby app context or in your custom vocabulary. **Edit Mode** works on selected text: highlight a paragraph, say "make this shorter", and it is rewritten in place. If you prefer a literal transcript, the README gives a simpler system prompt to paste into settings.

## Where your audio goes

There is no FreeFlow server. The only data that leaves the Mac is the API calls to the transcription and language-model provider you configured — Groq by default. Any OpenAI-compatible local or self-hosted provider can replace it; the README warns that local models are often slower, especially on cold starts and long recordings.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Mac users who want Wispr Flow-style cleanup today and are fine with a hosted model.
- People who dictate into many apps and want context-aware spelling.

**Look elsewhere**

- Audio must stay on the Mac by default. [VoiceInk](/apps/voiceink/) and [FluidVoice](/apps/fluidvoice/) transcribe on-device.
- You use Windows or Linux. See [Handy](/apps/handy/) or [Voicetypr](/apps/voicetypr/).

## How it compares

| | FreeFlow | [VoiceInk](/apps/voiceink/) | [FluidVoice](/apps/fluidvoice/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Transcription | Groq or your provider | On-device | On-device |
| Price of builds | Free | Paid after trial | Free |
| Licence | MIT | GPL-3.0 | GPL-3.0, private enhancement model |
