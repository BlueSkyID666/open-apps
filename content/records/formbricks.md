bestFor:
  - Product teams that want in-app and website surveys targeted at specific user groups.
  - Replacing a hosted survey tool while keeping responses on your own servers.
  - Feeding survey results into Slack, Notion, Zapier or n8n.
whyListed:
  - The README says the AGPL core is fully functional for link, website and in-app surveys.
  - Active since 2022, with release 6.0.0 published in September 2026.
  - Self-hostable with Docker without a subscription.
caveats:
  - Open-core — code under apps/web/modules/ee (SSO, teams, role management, audit logs, white-labelling,
    workflows and more) needs a paid Enterprise licence in production.
  - Usage telemetry is sent to Formbricks unless you set TELEMETRY_DISABLED.
  - The README says code contributions are accepted only as an exception for now.

Formbricks is the survey-first pick among open-source Typeform alternatives: beyond shareable link surveys, it targets in-app and website surveys at specific groups of users without changes to your application code. It describes itself as an open-source Qualtrics alternative and publishes a Typeform comparison on its site. It is open-core, and the line between the AGPL core and the enterprise directory matters for self-hosters. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 6.0.0.

## What it does

- **Survey types.** Link surveys you can share, website surveys, in-app surveys and email surveys.
- **Editor and templates.** A no-code editor with several question types and a library of best-practice templates.
- **Targeting.** Launch surveys to specific user groups without redeploying your app; SDKs for JavaScript, Android and iOS live in MIT-licensed packages.
- **Collaboration and integrations.** Invite organisation members, and send results to Slack, Notion, Zapier, n8n and more.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- SaaS product teams collecting feedback inside their own app.
- Organisations that need survey data on infrastructure they control.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want Typeform's one-question-at-a-time form builder without a product-feedback angle. [HeyForm](/apps/heyform/) and [OpnForm](/apps/opnform/) are form builders first.
- You run large academic or multilingual questionnaires. [LimeSurvey](/apps/limesurvey/) has been built for that since 2006.

## How it compares

| | Formbricks | [HeyForm](/apps/heyform/) | [OpnForm](/apps/opnform/) | [LimeSurvey](/apps/limesurvey/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Focus | In-app and web surveys | Conversational forms | Form builder | Survey research |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 core, enterprise directory | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0 core, enterprise directory | GPL-2.0 or later |
| Hosted option | Formbricks Cloud | HeyForm hosted service | OpnForm Cloud | LimeSurvey hosted |

All four are compared in [open-source Typeform alternatives](/collections/open-source-typeform-alternatives/).

## Licence in practice

The LICENSE file splits the repository three ways. Code under `apps/web/modules/ee` — SSO, teams, role management, two-factor authentication, audit logs, quotas, white-labelling, workflows, AI translation and others — is under the Formbricks Enterprise Edition licence and may be used in production only with a paid Enterprise licence. The JavaScript, Android and iOS SDKs and the API package are MIT. Everything else is AGPL-3.0. The self-hosted instance reports usage statistics to Formbricks unless `TELEMETRY_DISABLED=1` is set. More AGPL software is under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).
