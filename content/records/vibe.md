bestFor:
  - Batch-transcribing a folder of recordings on a laptop GPU.
  - Subtitles sized for videos and reels.
  - Transcribing a call from system audio without sending it anywhere.
whyListed:
  - Fully offline transcription with GPU acceleration on Nvidia, AMD and Intel through Vulkan, and
    CoreML on Macs.
  - Local summaries through Ollama, plus a CLI and an HTTP API for automation.
caveats:
  - It does not describe itself as an Otter.ai alternative; it is listed with them for transcribing
    recordings and system audio on your own computer. It does not detect or join meetings.
  - Summaries with the Claude API send the transcript to Anthropic; use Ollama to keep them local.

Vibe is a desktop transcription app built with Tauri and Rust. Drop in audio or video — or record the microphone or system audio — and it transcribes on your own machine with Whisper, Nemotron or Parakeet models, labels speakers, and exports to almost any format. Summaries can run locally through Ollama, so you get a transcript and notes without a cloud account. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v3.2.2.

## What it does

- **Transcribe** audio and video files, batches of files, links from YouTube, Vimeo and other sites, the microphone or system audio, with a real-time preview.
- **Speaker diarization** and a stable-timestamps mode for subtitle-grade timing.
- **Export** to SRT, VTT, TXT, HTML, PDF, JSON and DOCX, or print; choose caption length for videos and reels.
- **Summaries** with Ollama locally or the Claude API, and translation to English.
- **Record from your phone** — scan a QR code and your computer transcribes what the phone records.
- **Automation** — a CLI and an HTTP API with Swagger docs.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Anyone transcribing interviews, podcasts or lectures in many languages who wants the audio to stay local.
- People with a gaming GPU on Windows or Linux — Vulkan acceleration covers Nvidia, AMD and Intel.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want meetings detected and recorded for you: [OpenWhispr](/apps/openwhispr/) or [Minutes](/apps/minutes/).
- You want a Flatpak or Snap on Linux: [Buzz](/apps/buzz/).

## How it compares

| | Vibe | [Buzz](/apps/buzz/) | [OpenWhispr](/apps/openwhispr/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Built with | Tauri, Rust | Python | Electron, React |
| Speech models | Whisper, Nemotron, Parakeet | Whisper family | Whisper, Parakeet and others |
| Summaries | Ollama or Claude API | Plugin | Built in |
| Licence | MIT | MIT | MIT |

All are in [open-source Otter.ai alternatives](/collections/open-source-otter-alternatives/). More [Tauri](/stacks/tauri/) apps and [MIT apps](/licenses/mit/) are listed too.
