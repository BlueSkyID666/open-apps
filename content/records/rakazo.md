bestFor:
  - Bots that keep working on a server with their own browser, terminal and files while you are away.
  - Choosing the sandbox — local Docker, or E2B, Daytona, CreateOS or Box in the cloud.
  - Talking to a bot by voice with your own speech provider key.
whyListed:
  - Self-described Grok Bot alternative with the full shape — persistent bots, shared and private
    computers, bot-to-bot delegation and routines.
  - One installer brings up the stack with generated secrets; local Docker computers are on by
    default.
caveats:
  - Early-stage — the repository was created in August 2026 and the project calls itself beta.
  - Desktop builds cover macOS and Linux; Windows users use the web app or a server.
  - App integrations run through Composio or Pipedream Connect, which are third-party services.

Rakazo is the most direct open-source answer to Grok Bot: persistent AI teammates, each with its own conversations, memory, routines and a computer to work on, that you run yourself with your own model and sandbox. It is Apache-2.0 and comes from the author of Inbox Zero. It is also a beta that is barely two months old. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v0.1.6.

## What it does

A bot in Rakazo is more than a chat thread. It has its own history and memory, routines it runs on a schedule, and a computer — browser, terminal, files and a graphical desktop — that is either a shared Team Computer or an isolated Private one. Bots can hand work to peer bots or short-lived subagents. Voice mode lets you talk to a bot, dictate or call it, using your own ElevenLabs, OpenAI, Cartesia or Fish Audio key. Tools come from Composio or Pipedream Connect, remote MCP servers and OpenAPI sources.

## Running it

The published-images installer needs only Docker, Compose, curl and OpenSSL: it downloads the Compose files, writes an `.env` with random secrets and starts everything at `http://127.0.0.1:5173`. Local Docker computers are on by default; E2B, Daytona, CreateOS or Box can replace them with an API key. For bots that stay on, run the same installer on a VPS behind HTTPS and connect from the desktop or mobile app.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- People who liked the Grok Bot idea but want their own model, their own sandbox and their own data.
- Tinkerers comfortable running a Docker stack on a small server.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a stable product. Rakazo is a beta.
- You want an agent that builds its own apps and workflows. [Rome](/apps/rome/) is built around that.

## How it compares

| | Rakazo | [Rome](/apps/rome/) |
|---|---|---|
| Core idea | Persistent bots with their own computers | Agent OS that builds apps and workflows |
| Clients | Web, Electron desktop, Expo mobile | Web dashboard |
| Sandboxes | Docker, E2B, Daytona, CreateOS, Box | Docker |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 | MIT |
