whyListed:
  - AGPL-3.0 across the repository, with no enterprise directory.
  - Regular releases; v3.0.3 was published in September 2026.

caveats:
  - A small team — the README calls itself "the passionate duo behind HeyForm" and steers users toward
    the hosted service.
  - Fewer survey-research features than LimeSurvey, such as multilingual surveys or large question
    libraries.

HeyForm is the closest match to Typeform's style among open-source form builders: its website calls it "the open-source Typeform alternative", and it is built around conversational forms for surveys, quizzes and polls. The whole repository is AGPL-3.0 with no enterprise directory, which makes it the simplest licence story in this group. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v3.0.3.

## What it does

- **Inputs.** Text, email and phone fields, picture choices, date pickers and file uploads.
- **Logic.** Conditional logic and URL redirects for forms that adapt to answers.
- **Branding.** Themes with custom fonts, colours and backgrounds, plus custom CSS.
- **Results.** Analytics with drop-off and completion rates, and CSV export.
- **Integrations.** Webhooks, analytics and marketing platforms, Zapier and Make.com.

The monorepo holds a Node server, a React web app, a form renderer and an embed library for placing forms on other sites. Self-hosted instances can sign users in through a generic OpenID Connect provider such as Authelia, Authentik or Keycloak.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Anyone who likes Typeform's one-question-at-a-time forms and wants to self-host them.
- Organisations that want an open-source licence with no separate paid code in the repository.

**Look elsewhere**

- You need in-app surveys targeted at users of your product. [Formbricks](/apps/formbricks/) does that.
- You run academic or multilingual questionnaires. [LimeSurvey](/apps/limesurvey/) is built for research.

## How it compares

| | HeyForm | [OpnForm](/apps/opnform/) | [Formbricks](/apps/formbricks/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Style | Conversational forms | Multi-step or single-page forms | Surveys, in-app and on the web |
| Stack | Node and React | Laravel and Nuxt | Next.js |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 | AGPL-3.0 core, enterprise directory | AGPL-3.0 core, enterprise directory |
