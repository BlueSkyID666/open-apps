bestFor:
  - Speaking a messy thought and getting a clean, structured prompt for ChatGPT, Claude or Cursor.
  - Chinese and English dictation with Chinese cloud speech providers.
  - Switching writing styles with a keystroke.
whyListed:
  - Rewriting speech into a chosen style is the core feature, not an add-on.
  - Builds for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android from one repository.
  - A dictionary that learns from your corrections and feeds hotwords to the speech provider.
caveats:
  - Early-stage — the repository was created in April 2026.
  - Cloud-first. Setup expects speech and language-model credentials (the README's walkthrough uses
    Volcengine); local speech recognition is bundled on macOS and experimental on Windows.
  - Most providers in the default list are Chinese cloud services; OpenAI-compatible endpoints are
    supported.

OpenLess is the open-source app closest to what makes Wispr Flow feel different from plain dictation: it does not just transcribe, it rewrites what you said in a style you picked, and its headline "AI-prompt mode" turns a spoken ramble into a structured prompt for a chatbot or coding agent. It is AGPL-3.0 and ships for Windows, macOS, Linux and Android. The trade-off is that it is cloud-first — you bring speech and model credentials — and young. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v1.3.18.

## What it does

Put the cursor in any text field, hold the hotkey and speak. OpenLess records, sends the audio to the speech provider you configured, polishes the transcript with a language model in the current mode, and streams the result into the field character by character, with a clipboard fallback. **Style packs** fix tone once and switch with a key. The **dictionary** learns: correct a word it wrote and it offers to remember it, and entries are sent as hotwords to providers that support them.

## Where your audio goes

This is the question to answer before installing. The README lists cloud speech providers — Volcengine, Tencent Cloud, iFlytek, Alibaba Cloud Bailian, StepFun and others — and polish providers including DeepSeek, OpenAI, Gemini, OpenRouter and any OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Local speech recognition is bundled on macOS (Qwen3-ASR), with Windows variants using Foundry Local Whisper and sherpa-onnx marked experimental. For fully offline dictation on Windows today, [Handy](/apps/handy/) or [Voicetypr](/apps/voicetypr/) are the safer picks.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Heavy users of chatbots and coding agents who think out loud.
- Bilingual Chinese–English writers.

**Look elsewhere**

- Audio must never leave your computer on Windows — see above.
- You want a mature, stable app; releases are frequent and the project is months old.

## How it compares

| | OpenLess | [Handy](/apps/handy/) | [Voicetypr](/apps/voicetypr/) | [FreeFlow](/apps/freeflow/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platforms | Windows, macOS, Linux, Android | Windows, macOS, Linux | Windows, macOS | macOS |
| Transcription | Cloud; local on macOS | Local | Local by default | Cloud (Groq by default) |
| AI rewrite | Core feature, style packs | Optional | Optional | Context-aware cleanup |
| Licence | AGPL-3.0 | MIT | AGPL-3.0 | MIT |

All of them are in [open-source Wispr Flow alternatives](/collections/open-source-wispr-flow-alternatives/).

## Licence in practice

AGPL-3.0 for the whole repository. Using it is unrestricted; if you modify it and let others use your version over a network, you must publish your changes. The repository ships no API keys, and new credentials are written to the operating system's credential store. More AGPL apps are under [AGPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/agpl-3.0/).
