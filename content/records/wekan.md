bestFor:
  - Teams moving boards off Trello onto their own server, with an importer for the move.

  - Large installations — the README cites a user with 30,000 people on one company instance.
whyListed:
  - MIT-licensed and in development since 2014, with several releases a week when checked.
  - States plainly that it has no telemetry.
  - Imports from Trello, Jira, Asana, CSV and other formats.
caveats:
  - Needs at least 1 GB of free RAM, and the README recommends 4 GB for a production server.
  - There is no undo yet; the maintainers ask for daily database backups, and only the newest release
    is supported.

WeKan is the long-running, self-hosted Kanban board closest to the Trello way of working: boards, lists and cards that update in real time for everyone, plus swimlanes, WIP limits and an importer for your existing Trello boards. In development since 2014 — it began as a Trello clone called Metrello — it is MIT-licensed and says outright that it has no telemetry. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v12.08.

## What it does

- **Boards, lists and cards** in a real-time interface, with swimlanes, WIP limits, filters, keyboard shortcuts and a Markdown editor.
- **Members and administration** — board members, member settings and an admin panel.
- **Automation and integration** through webhooks and an OpenAPI description.
- **Import and export** for Trello, Jira, Asana, Kanboard, ZenKit, CSV and Excel.
- **Translations** into 234 languages through Transifex.

It runs on MongoDB, with Docker Compose files for FerretDB on PostgreSQL, MySQL and other databases, and installs from Docker images, the Snap Store and other platforms listed on wekan.fi.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Companies and public bodies that want Trello-style boards on their own servers, including offline networks.
- Teams that want a permissive licence and no telemetry.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want something tiny to run. [Kanboard](/apps/kanboard/) is a small PHP app.
- You want list, Gantt and to-do views as well as boards. [Vikunja](/apps/vikunja/) offers four views.

## How it compares

| | WeKan | [Kanboard](/apps/kanboard/) | [Vikunja](/apps/vikunja/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Trello import | Yes | Not a focus | Yes |
| Stack | Meteor, MongoDB or FerretDB | PHP; SQLite, MySQL or PostgreSQL | Go and Vue |
| Licence | MIT | MIT | AGPL-3.0 |

More boards are in [open-source Trello alternatives](/collections/open-source-trello-alternatives/). More permissive software is under [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).

## Running it

Plan for at least 1 GB of free RAM and 4 GB on a production server; the README describes much larger multi-server setups for thousands of users. Keep it updated — only the newest release is supported — and back up the database daily, because there is no undo yet and a full disk can corrupt MongoDB. Paid support is available from the maintainers.
