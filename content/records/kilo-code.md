bestFor:
  - Cursor-style agent work and tab-to-accept autocomplete inside VS Code or a JetBrains IDE.
  - Switching between 500+ models mid-task and paying provider rates.
  - Running the same agent unattended in CI with `kilo run --auto`.
whyListed:
  - Compares itself directly with Cursor and GitHub Copilot on its own site, and is MIT-licensed.
  - One agent across VS Code, JetBrains and the terminal, with Code, Plan, Ask and Debug modes.
caveats:
  - Getting started uses a Kilo account; bring-your-own-key and local models are supported.
  - Cloud Agents and automated code reviews run on Kilo's hosted service at app.kilo.ai.
  - The CLI is a fork of OpenCode, so the two overlap heavily in the terminal.

Kilo Code is the option that goes head to head with both Cursor and GitHub Copilot: its own site asks "Why switch from Cursor to Kilo Code?" and compares itself with Copilot, and the extension does both jobs — an agent that writes and debugs across files, and ghost-text autocomplete. The code is MIT; the business is model credits at provider rates plus hosted cloud agents and code reviews. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v7.8.1.

## What it does

- **Agents you switch between.** Code (the default), Plan (architecture and implementation plans), Ask (answers without touching files) and Debug, plus custom agents.
- **Autocomplete.** Inline ghost-text suggestions, tab to accept.
- **Terminal and browser control**, and a marketplace for agents, skills, MCP servers and plugins.
- **500+ models**, switchable mid-task, through a Kilo account at the provider's rate with no markup, your own API keys, or local models.
- **Autonomous mode.** `kilo run --auto` approves permission prompts unless a rule denies them, for CI pipelines.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Developers who want to stay in VS Code or a JetBrains IDE rather than move to Cursor.
- Teams that want Copilot-style completion and an agent in one extension, with open pricing.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want nothing to leave your network, with no vendor account at all — see [twinny](/apps/twinny/).
- You want a different, native editor — see [Zed](/apps/zed/).

## How it compares

| | Kilo Code | [Cline](/apps/cline/) | [twinny](/apps/twinny/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Editors | VS Code, JetBrains, CLI | VS Code, JetBrains, CLI, desktop | VS Code |
| Autocomplete | Yes | Not listed in its README | Yes |
| Paid side | Credits, cloud agents, code reviews | Pricing at cline.bot | Team gateway licence |
| Licence | MIT | Apache-2.0 | MIT |
