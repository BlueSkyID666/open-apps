Baserow is the permissively licensed way to replace Airtable on your own server: its description calls it the "best Airtable alternative", and its open-source edition is MIT. Around the spreadsheet-style database it has grown an application builder, automations, dashboards and an AI assistant. It is open-core, with premium and enterprise features in separately licensed directories. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release 2.3.4.

## What it does

- **Database.** A spreadsheet and database hybrid with grid, form and kanban views, running on PostgreSQL.
- **Applications.** Build apps and portals on top of your data and publish them on your own domain.
- **Automations and dashboards.** Automate repetitive workflows and chart your data.
- **AI assistant.** Kuma creates databases and workflows from natural-language requests.
- **API first.** A REST API with an OpenAPI schema, so other tools can use Baserow as a back end.

The stack is Django, Vue.js and PostgreSQL. Self-hosting starts with a single `docker run` command; the README also documents Helm, Docker Compose, Heroku, Render, DigitalOcean, AWS, Cloudron and Railway.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Teams moving off Airtable who want to keep a permissive licence on what they deploy.
- Organisations that want tables and a simple front end for them in one tool.

**Look elsewhere**

- You think in formulas and want Python in your cells. [Grist](/apps/grist/) is closer to a spreadsheet.
- You are building internal tools on existing databases and APIs. [Appsmith](/apps/appsmith/) and the [Retool alternatives](/collections/open-source-retool-alternatives/) fit better.

## How it compares

| | Baserow | [Teable](/apps/teable/) | [Grist](/apps/grist/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Licence | MIT core, premium and enterprise directories | AGPL-3.0 core, paid features in image | Apache-2.0 core, proprietary extras |
| App builder | Yes | Paid AI App Builder | No, widgets and dashboards |
| Since | 2020 | 2022 | 2020 (grist-core) |

The full comparison is in [open-source Airtable alternatives](/collections/open-source-airtable-alternatives/). More permissive software is under [MIT-licensed apps](/licenses/mit/).

## Licence in practice

The LICENSE file splits the repository. Everything outside `premium/` and `enterprise/` — the Baserow Open Source Edition — is MIT, and so is all client-side JavaScript as served to the browser. Code under `premium/` and `enterprise/` is under Baserow's Premium and Enterprise licences, which allow production use only with a valid subscription for the right number of users. Documentation is CC BY-SA 4.0.
