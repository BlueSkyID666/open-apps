Appsmith is the permissively licensed choice for replacing Retool: a low-code platform for admin panels, dashboards and internal tools, with the whole public repository under Apache-2.0. Appsmith lists itself first in its own round-up of Retool alternatives. Paid plans exist, but the self-hosted Community Edition is a complete builder. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v2.4.2.

## What it does

- **Build.** Assemble dashboards, admin panels, customer 360 views, IT automation and service-management tools from ready-made widgets.
- **Connect.** More than 25 databases and any API as data sources.
- **Code.** Write JavaScript alongside the visual builder to transform data and control behaviour.
- **Ship.** Version apps with Git, and deploy with Docker, Kubernetes or an AWS AMI.
- **Templates.** A public template library to start from.

Appsmith is also building Appsmith Agents, an AI agent platform for business teams; the README introduces it but does not say how it relates to the open-source edition.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Developers who build internal tools for operations, support and finance teams.
- Companies that need the builder on their own infrastructure under a permissive licence.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want an AI app generator and workflows in the self-hosted core. [ToolJet](/apps/tooljet/) has them, but in its paid edition.
- You want a spreadsheet-style database rather than a front end over your own. See [Baserow](/apps/baserow/).

## How it compares

| | Appsmith | [ToolJet](/apps/tooljet/) | [Budibase](/apps/budibase/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Built-in database | No | ToolJet Database | Budibase data tables |
| AI features | Appsmith Agents (separate) | Paid ToolJet AI; MCP server | Agents and automations |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 | AGPL-3.0, enterprise submodules | GPL-3.0, BSL pro package |

The full comparison is in [open-source Retool alternatives](/collections/open-source-retool-alternatives/). More developer software is under [Developer Tools](/categories/developer-tools/).

## Licence in practice

Apache-2.0 covers the repository. Appsmith's pricing page describes the Community edition as "our open-source low code application platform, available for free", with Business and Enterprise plans on top. The documentation says telemetry is optional and anonymised for self-hosted instances; turn it off under Admin Settings or with an environment variable. A keep-alive ping every two hours is sent whether telemetry is on or off.
