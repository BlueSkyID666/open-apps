VoiceInk is the established on-device dictation app for Macs: public since 2024, GPL-3.0, transcribing locally with whisper.cpp, Parakeet and other models, and reshaping its output per app. It is open source with a commercial model — the signed builds with automatic updates are paid after a trial, and anyone can build the source for free. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v2.21.

## What it does

Trigger it with a keyboard or mouse shortcut, speak, and the transcript lands at the cursor. Transcription runs on the Mac. **Modes** detect the app or URL you are in and apply the settings you set for it, so the same sentence can come out casual in Slack and formal in email. A **personal dictionary** handles names, industry terms and replacements, a context-aware option uses what is on screen, and an assistant mode answers spoken questions.

The acknowledgements list the engines: whisper.cpp for Whisper, FluidAudio for Parakeet, and SenseVoice Small, which comes under the FunASR model licence rather than GPL.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Mac users who want dictation that never leaves the machine and will pay once for convenience.
- People who write in many apps with different tones.

**Look elsewhere**

- You are on macOS 14 or older — VoiceInk needs 15.
- You want free signed builds. [FluidVoice](/apps/fluidvoice/) and [FreeFlow](/apps/freeflow/) are free.
- You use Windows or Linux. See [Handy](/apps/handy/).

## How it compares

| | VoiceInk | [FluidVoice](/apps/fluidvoice/) | [FreeFlow](/apps/freeflow/) | [Handy](/apps/handy/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Transcription | On-device | On-device | Groq or your provider | On-device |
| Per-app behaviour | Modes | Per-app prompts | App context | No |
| Builds | Paid after trial | Free | Free | Free |
| Licence | GPL-3.0 | GPL-3.0 | MIT | MIT |

## Licence in practice

The source is GPL-3.0 — read from the LICENSE file, although GitHub's licence detection shows "NOASSERTION". Build it yourself for free, or buy a licence for signed builds, updates and support. The maintainer does not take pull requests; you can still fork. More GPL software is under [GPL-3.0 apps](/licenses/gpl-3.0/).
