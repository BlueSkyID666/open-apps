summary: A Rust app that records meetings, calls, voice memos and dictation, transcribes them on your
  device and saves each one as a Markdown file with structured YAML — then lets Claude Code, Codex,
  Cursor or any MCP client search that history.
description: Minutes is an MIT-licensed, local-first meeting and voice-memo recorder with on-device
  transcription, Markdown output, a CLI and an MCP server, for macOS and Windows with a CLI on Linux.
sourceDescription: Open-source, local-first Granola/Otter alternative that Claude Code, Codex, Cursor,
  and any MCP client can query. Meetings, calls, and voice memos transcribed on-device into markdown
  you own.

  - cli

bestFor:
  - Asking your coding agent what was decided in last month's meetings.
  - Keeping meeting notes as plain Markdown in an Obsidian or Logseq vault.
  - Leaving Granola with your archive — there is an import guide.
whyListed:
  - Capture, transcription and storage run locally; text leaves only when you send it to an AI
    provider you chose.
  - Meetings are Markdown with YAML frontmatter for decisions and action items, readable by any tool.
  - A CLI, an MCP server, a Claude Code plugin and a TypeScript SDK over the same files.
caveats:
  - The desktop app ships for Apple Silicon Macs and Windows; on Linux the supported path is the CLI.
  - Summaries use the AI provider you configure — a cloud provider receives the meeting context you
    authorise.

Minutes treats meetings as memory for your AI tools. It records meetings, calls, voice memos and dictation, transcribes them on your own machine, and writes each one to `~/meetings/` as Markdown with YAML frontmatter for decisions and action items. Claude Code, Codex, Cursor or any MCP client can then search that history. It is MIT-licensed, and the README commits to no relicensing and no paid tier for anything in the repository. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v0.27.0.

## What it does

- **Record and transcribe** meetings, calls, voice memos and dictation, with on-device transcription and speaker processing (Whisper, or Parakeet on supported installs).
- **Plain files** — Markdown plus structured frontmatter that Obsidian, grep or any Markdown tool can read.
- **Agent access** — an MCP server (34 tools), a CLI (58 commands), a Claude Code plugin and a TypeScript SDK.
- **Desktop app** — menu-bar capture, recall, documents and live coaching.
- **Consent tools** — reminders and acknowledgement for disclosing a recording; sensitive meetings can be saved as markers without audio.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Developers and founders who already live in Claude Code, Cursor or Codex.
- Anyone who wants meeting notes in the same Markdown vault as everything else.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a polished notepad on Linux: [anarlog](/apps/anarlog/) ships Linux desktop builds.
- You want dictation first and meetings second: [OpenWhispr](/apps/openwhispr/).

## How it compares

| | Minutes | [anarlog](/apps/anarlog/) | [Meetily](/apps/meetily/) | [OpenWhispr](/apps/openwhispr/) |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Platforms | macOS, Windows (CLI on Linux) | macOS, Windows, Linux | macOS, Windows | macOS, Windows, Linux |
| Where notes live | Markdown files | Local SQLite | Local | Local, optional cloud sync |
| Summary model | Your chosen provider | Local, your key, or hosted | Local, through Ollama | Local or cloud |
| Licence | MIT | MIT plus enterprise code | MIT, paid PRO tier | MIT, paid cloud plans |

It is listed in [open-source Granola alternatives](/collections/open-source-granola-alternatives/) and [open-source Otter.ai alternatives](/collections/open-source-otter-alternatives/).

## Licence in practice

MIT for the whole repository, with no paid tier inside it. If you point summaries at a cloud AI provider, the meeting context you authorise goes to that provider; transcription itself stays local. More MIT apps are under [MIT apps](/licenses/mit/), and more [Tauri](/stacks/tauri/) apps are listed too.
