summary: A single Go binary that runs Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Grok Build, OpenCode or a
  shell in reattachable terminal sessions on an always-on host, and lets you drive them from a web
  admin, a Flutter mobile app or six chat platforms, with a shared local-first memory layer.

bestFor:
  - Keeping a long Claude Code or Codex session alive when your laptop sleeps.
  - Checking on and replying to a running coding agent from your phone or Telegram.
  - Small teams sharing a host and a pool of agent accounts.
whyListed:
  - Sessions survive client disconnects, laptop sleep and host reboots, and reattach where they left
    off.
  - One static Go binary with PostgreSQL, no telemetry, cosign-signed releases and an SBOM.
caveats:
  - Early-stage and small — the repository was created in May 2026 and had 67 stars when checked.
  - Needs PostgreSQL and a host that stays on; Docker is not a supported deployment for v2.
  - Pooling several accounts on one host may conflict with your AI provider's terms — check them
    before sharing a subscription.

opendray solves one concrete problem: a coding agent run over SSH dies when your laptop sleeps. It runs Claude Code, Codex, Antigravity, Grok Build, OpenCode or a plain shell in a terminal session on a host that stays awake — a Mac mini, a NAS, a VPS — and lets you reattach later from a browser, a phone or a chat message, with the transcript where you left it. It is a young, small project; this is a short record rather than a full review. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v2.17.8.

## What it does

- **Sessions that survive.** Each agent CLI runs in its own reattachable PTY on the host and outlives client disconnects, sleep and reboots.
- **Drive from anywhere.** A React web admin, a Flutter mobile app, and Telegram, Slack, Discord, Feishu, DingTalk and WeCom, all two-way — get pinged when a session goes idle and reply to send the next prompt.
- **Shared memory.** Recall across user, project and session scopes, with embeddings from ONNX, Ollama or LM Studio, stored in your PostgreSQL.
- **An API.** REST and WebSocket with scoped keys and a per-call audit log, so it can be the agent runtime behind your own tool.

The README is clear about where it differs from self-hosted chat front ends such as Open WebUI or LibreChat: it runs the real agent CLI, with tool use and file writes on the host, not a chat box in front of an API.

## Who it is for

A solo developer with a box that is always on, or a small team lead who wants teammates to share a host. If you want an agent that lives in a team Slack channel, look at [OpenTag](/apps/opentag/) or the other [open-source Claude Tag alternatives](/collections/open-source-claude-tag-alternatives/). If you want the agent on your desktop, see [OpenWork](/apps/openwork/).

## Running it

On Linux, macOS or WSL2, the install script walks through PostgreSQL, CLI installation, admin credentials and service registration in five to ten minutes; Windows runs the same installer inside WSL2. `npx opendray` installs the binary alone if you bring your own PostgreSQL and supervisor. The web admin is at `http://<host>:8770/admin/`. Because opendray shares process state such as `~/.claude` and the ssh-agent with the CLIs it spawns, it runs on the host under systemd or launchd, not in Docker.
