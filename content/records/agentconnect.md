summary: A self-hosted platform that puts several AI agents — Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build or any
  ACP runtime — into Slack, Telegram, Discord, Lark, Google Chat, GitHub, GitLab, Gitea and Linear,
  each with its own role, memory, tools and access rules.

  tools and code hosts your team already uses, self-hosted with Docker Compose.
sourceDescription: The open-source, multi-agent alternative to Claude Tag. @ any agent, wherever
  work happens, they work alongside your team, learning as they go.

bestFor:
  - Teams that want more than one agent in a channel, each with a defined role.
  - Starting agent work from a GitHub pull request, an issue, a webhook or a schedule as well as chat.
  - Mixing runtimes — Claude Code for one job, Codex or another ACP agent for the next.
whyListed:
  - Describes itself as an open-source Claude Tag alternative and covers far more channels than Slack.
  - Per-agent visibility, repository, tool and agent-to-agent permissions are part of the core.
caveats:
  - Early-stage — the repository was created in July 2026; v2.0.0 shipped on the day it was checked.
  - Routing decisions use Jev, a separate decision engine from the same ecosystem.
  - A hosted AgentConnect Cloud exists beside the self-hosted stack.

AgentConnect is the Claude Tag alternative for teams that want a roster of agents rather than one: each agent gets a role, a runtime, a model, memory and its own permissions, and they can call on each other in the same thread as the people working with them. It self-hosts under Apache-2.0 and reaches well beyond Slack. It is also two months old, so pin a version. Verified against the repository on 28 September 2026, at release v2.0.0.

## What it does

You define agents in a web console and link them to bots in Slack, Telegram, Discord, Lark and Google Chat, or to repositories and workflows on GitHub, GitLab, Gitea and Linear. Work can start from a message, an issue, a pull request, a webhook or a schedule. Any ACP-compatible runtime can sit behind an agent — the README names Claude Code, Codex, Grok Build, DeepSeek and Pi — and changing one does not rebuild the workflow around it.

Routing uses reusable "Decisions" powered by Jev: which agent answers, which specialist gets a new conversation, which runtime and model a session uses. Agents keep their own memory and skills, and reviewed "Knowledge" pages are shared across all of them.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Support and triage flows that cross Slack, Telegram and an issue tracker.
- Code review with several specialised reviewers chosen per pull request.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want one teammate in one Slack workspace with the least setup. [OpenTag](/apps/opentag/) is narrower.
- You want each conversation in an isolated container with shell and tools. [Centaur](/apps/centaur/) is built around Kubernetes sandboxes.

## How it compares

| | AgentConnect | [Centaur](/apps/centaur/) | [OpenTag](/apps/opentag/) |
|---|---|---|---|
| Channels | Slack, Telegram, Discord, Lark, Google Chat + code hosts | Slack, API | Slack |
| Agents | Many, with roles | Shared agent, any CLI harness | One ACP coding agent |
| Execution | Daemons you add | Kubernetes sandbox per thread | Your own paired computer |
| Licence | Apache-2.0 | MIT or Apache-2.0 | MIT |

All three are compared in [open-source Claude Tag alternatives](/collections/open-source-claude-tag-alternatives/).

## Running it

`docker compose up -d` in a checkout starts the web console, control plane, relay and PostgreSQL; open `http://localhost:3000` and add a daemon from the console. Helm charts live in `charts/` for Kubernetes. The licence covers the whole repository — Apache-2.0, read from the LICENSE file.
