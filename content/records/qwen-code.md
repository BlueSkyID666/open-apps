bestFor:
  - A Claude Code-style terminal agent that can run Qwen, other hosted models or local ones.
  - Driving a coding agent from Telegram, DingTalk, WeChat or Feishu.
  - Scripting agent runs headless or through TypeScript, Python and Java SDKs.
whyListed:
  - Its README compares it with Claude Code feature by feature and aims for parity.
  - Apache-2.0, with the Qwen models it is tuned for also released openly.
caveats:
  - It does not call itself a Claude Code alternative; its README says "If you know Claude Code, you
    already know Qwen Code", and it is listed with them for doing the same job.
  - Usage statistics can be collected when you sign in with Qwen OAuth or an Alibaba Cloud plan; the
    privacy notice says you can opt out in settings, and API-key use adds no collection.
  - The web UI and daemon mode are marked experimental.

Qwen Code measures itself against Claude Code more openly than most: its README opens its capabilities section with "If you know Claude Code, you already know Qwen Code" and lists the two side by side. It began as a fork of Google's Gemini CLI and has been developed independently since v0.1, with deep support for Qwen models but no lock-in to them. Verified against the repository on 29 September 2026, at release v0.24.6.

## What it does

Run `qwen` in a project, pick a provider with `/auth`, and ask. The README's comparison table claims parity with Claude Code on subagents and agent teams, auto-memory and skills, hooks, MCP, plan mode, LSP integration, sandboxing, Git worktrees, computer use and headless mode, and adds what Claude Code does not have:

- **Multi-protocol models** — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini and Qwen APIs, any third-party provider, or local models through Ollama or vLLM, switchable at runtime.
- **Agent Arena** — several models on the same task, head to head.
- **Daemon mode** — `qwen serve` shares one agent between several clients (experimental).
- **Chat channels** — Telegram, DingTalk, WeChat and Feishu.

It also ships a desktop app for macOS, Windows and Linux, plugins for VS Code, Zed and JetBrains, and SDKs for TypeScript, Python and Java.

## Who it is for, and who it is not for

**A good fit**

- Claude Code users who want the same habits with a choice of models.
- Teams in regions or companies that already use Qwen or Alibaba Cloud models.

**Look elsewhere**

- You want a narrower tool, just a terminal agent and a desktop app — see [OpenCode](/apps/opencode/).
- You want an agent in the editor with diff review — see [Cline](/apps/cline/).

## Licence in practice

The code is Apache-2.0. Data handling depends on how you sign in: with an API key, the privacy notice says Qwen Code collects nothing beyond what your provider does; with Qwen OAuth or an Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan, usage statistics follow that provider's policy and can be switched off in settings. More Apache-licensed tools are under [Apache-2.0 apps](/licenses/apache-2.0/).

The comparison continues in [open-source Claude Code alternatives](/collections/open-source-claude-code-alternatives/).
